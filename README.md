# philips-hue-blue
Simple library to control philips hue BLE lights with a raspberry pi + bluez
Quick note: This eliminates the need for a BLE bridge.  Run huep.py to create a 'server' and lightinterface to communicate with that so you don't have to re-pair/connect every time you want to send a command, etc etc.
