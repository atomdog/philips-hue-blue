# philips-hue-blue
Simple library to control philips hue BLE lights with a raspberry pi + bluez
Quick note: This eliminates the need for a BLE bridge. Big companies LOVE to tell you that product x or y is necessary. It isn't. Run huep.py to create a 'server' and lightinterface to communicate with that so you don't have to re-pair/connect every time you want to send a command, etc etc.
